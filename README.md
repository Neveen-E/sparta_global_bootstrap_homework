#Bootstrap Homework

## Summary

Added bootstrap classes to stylize the profile and project pages and make them responsive.


The main Bootstrap features that were used to succesfully style the page are:

 - The Grid System (using columns and rows).
 - Navbar 
 - Containers 
 
 Additional style elements and classes were used to finish styling the pages.
